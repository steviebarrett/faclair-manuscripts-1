					<p>'Aingil Dé dom dhín' is a Middle Gaelic verse litany, praising and invoking
						the protection of seven archangels (one for each of the seven days of the
						week) and the twelve apostles. It was probably composed in Ireland but
						inscribed around 1500 on the flyleaf of <ref target="#MS2">Egerton
							2899,</ref>, a Psalter belonging to the Campbells of Glenorchy. It shows
						little to no influence from Scottish Gaelic but was evidently valued in the
						elite learned culture of Argyll at the time.</p>

						<provenance><p>According to Flower (<ref target="#Flower1926">1926</ref>:
							23), <ref target="#MS2">Egerton 2899</ref> began life in the 14th
							century as a Psalter. About a century later, this was joined by a
							tabulated martyrology. The latter’s emphasis is on Scottish saints,
							some very local to Argyll. This, combined with an inscription
							implying that the manuscript was the property of <name
								type="personal">Colin Campbell</name>, Laird of Glenorchy (d.
							1523), and a 18th-century bookplate of his descendants, the Earls of
							Breadalbane suggests an <location>
								<region>Argyll</region>
							</location> provenance for the gathering containing the martyrology.
							'<ref target="#MS2.1">Aingil Dé dom dhín</ref>' would have been
							added in this context (around 1500). Technically, the Psalter could
							be from elsewhere.</p></provenance>

								<p>Thomas O'Nolan (<ref target="#ONolan1912">1912</ref>) has edited
									'Aingil Dé dom dhín', although without using <ref target="#MS2"

									manuscripts: <list>
										<item>Dublin, Royal Irish Academy, MS 23.P.16 (1230), 15th

								<p>The <ref target="#MS2">Egerton 2899</ref> text thus seems to
									align structurally with the <hi rend="italics">Leabhar
										Breac</hi> and Laud Misc. 615 texts. This is not
									particularly borne out by a comparison between the <hi
										rend="italics">varia lectiones</hi> in O'Nolan's edition,
									however. While the <ref target="#MS2">Egerton 2899</ref> text
									never closely aligns in any serious way with the others against
									the <hi rend="italics">Leabhar Breac</hi> and Laud Misc. 615, it
									often presents its own distinctive readings against them.</p>
								<p>It seems fairly likely that the omission of q7 was a mistake at a
									certain point in the tradition. qq5–7 list seven archangels,
									describing each of them as a “crown” (<hi rend="italics"
										>cor</hi>). q8 then calls them “the seven crowns on the head
									of God” (<hi rend="italics">Seacht cuir dar cend De</hi>). Given
									that three of these crowns (Raphael, Painiel, and Gabriel) are
									enumerated in q7, it was almost certainly in the original
									composition. The <hi rend="italics">Leabhar Breac</hi>, Laud
									Misc. 615, and <ref target="#MS2">Egerton 2899</ref> texts thus
									all have a common ancestor somewhere below the archetype where
									this omission occured. This archetype must have existed by the
									period 1408×1411, when the <hi rend="italics">Leabhar Breac</hi>
									was produced.</p>
								<p>From the evidence of textual history, attestation in the
									manuscript record and language (see below), we can conclude that
									the poem was originally composed in Ireland, probably in the
									Middle Gaelic period.</p>

								<note>
									<p> In the linguistic survey that follows, I focus on the <ref
											target="#MS2">Egerton 2899</ref> text of '<ref
											target="#MS2.1">Aingil Dé dom dhin</ref>'.</p>
									<p>The text may have been written originally in early Middle
										Gaelic, as it preserves some forms and is largely compliant
										with the norms of Middle Gaelic. However, there are several
										Early Modern forms that possibly appeared during the poem's
										transmission or possibly call for the dating of its
										composition later in the Middle Gaelic period rather than
										earlier. While the poem was inscribed in Argyll by a
										Scottish scribe, there seems to be negligible influence from
										Scottish Gaelic.</p>
									<p>It should be noted that the poem does not provide a great
										deal of linguistic data that could be used to ascertain date
										or provenance; it includes relatively few verbs, for
										example, and makes no references to secular history.</p>
									<p>Old Gaelic or conservative Middle Gaelic features include: <list>

									<p>Possible signs of Scottish Gaelic influence : <list>
