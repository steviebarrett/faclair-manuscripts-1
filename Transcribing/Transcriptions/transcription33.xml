                                        <p>This document sets out the terms of an agreement between
                                                An Calbhach Ó Domhnaill (d. 1566) and Giolla
                                                Easbuig Mac Cailin, 5th Earl of Argyll (1538–1575).
                                                It was written in 1560 in Early Modern Gaelic by an
                                                accomplished scribe. The scribe is anonymous and the
                                                place of writing is unknown; it could have been
                                                drawn up in either Ulster or Argyll. However, as the
                                                agreement would in any case have needed to have been
                                                in language that was accessible to both parties, it
                                                remains a valuable source for Gaelic administrative
                                                and legal literacy among elites of the period. It is
                                                also a particularly rich source of vocabulary on
                                                politics, military organization, and seafaring.</p>

                                                  Argyll-O'Donnell Agreement, written in Early
                                                  Modern Gaelic in 1560. It is a legal document,
                                                  setting out and renewing the terms of a previous
                                                  agreement reached by An Calbhach with the previous
                                                  Earl of Argyll (Giolla Easbuig Mac Cailin, 4th
                                                  Earl of Argyll, 1498–1558) in 1555, under which An
                                                  Calbhach would receive military aid in exchange
                                                  for an annual payment and the billeting of
                                                  Argyll's troops in his lands in Ireland. An
                                                  Calbhach required military aid as he was trying to
                                                  wrest control of the lordship of Tír Conaill from
                                                  his father, Maghnus. The agreement is presumably
                                                  being renewed because, by 1560, (a) An Calbhach
                                                  had obtained the lordship of Tír Conaill and (b)
                                                  there was a new Earl of Argyll. All other
                                                  documents relating to the 1555 agreement are now
                                                  lost.</p>
                                                  <p>The person or persons responsible for drawing
                                                  up the present document are unknown and the scribe
                                                  is anonymous. While it could have been composed in
                                                  either Argyll or Ulster, as Argyll is the dominant
                                                  party in the relationship, one might suspect that
                                                  he or his agents would have been the major
                                                  influence on the terms of the agreement. In any
                                                  case, the language must have been comprehensible
                                                  to him and to the various officials in Argyll who
                                                  might have needed to familiarise themselves with
                                                  its terms.</p>

                                                <summary><p>As noted above, it is not whether the
                                                  treaty was drawn up in Argyll or Ulster, although
                                                  it seems likely that Earl of Argyll or his agents
                                                  would have had the predominant influence on the
                                                  content. The present document bears the signature
                                                  of Ó Domhnaill but not that of Argyll and the day
                                                  and month have been left blank. This suggests that
                                                  it was intended to be Argyll's eventual copy,
                                                  which would have been signed by Ó Domhnaill and
                                                  then sent to Argyll to be both signed and retained
                                                  by him. However, for some reason, the ratification
                                                  process was left incomplete as far as this
                                                  document is concerned. Various transcriptions,
                                                  translations (one contemporary with the
                                                  agreement), and abstracts derived from this
                                                  version (MS33) are reportedly to be found among
                                                  the Argyll Papers (Black <ref target="https://bill.celt.dias.ie/vol4/displayObject.php?TreeID=16049">2016</ref>: 55–56) at Inveraray. Further study of
                                                  these might elucidate the provenance and status of
                                                  the present document further. Otherwise, it is
                                                  first attested as being at Inveraray in the late
                                                  19th century, as it was studied by the 10th Duke
                                                  of Argyll.</p></summary>

                                <p>The language of the agreement is largely conformant to the
                                        conventions of literary Early Modern Gaelic. There are some
                                        conservative features, such as preserved accusatives,
                                        although no archaisms like infixed pronouns. This is roughly
                                        what would be expected from the text of a formal,
                                        high-status document of this period, even if it does also
                                        have a practical purpose. In terms of orthography and even
                                        morphology, there are some potential signs of Scottish
                                        Gaelic influence (e.g. spread of dental declension endings,
                                        some of which have been devoiced from /γ/ to /χ/; devoicing
                                        of /γ/ to /χ/ elsewhere; possible orthographic evidence of
                                        pre-aspiration). However, they are for the most part also
                                        equally explicable as features of a northern dialect of
                                        Irish. Consideration of language and orthography
                                        unfortunately does not enable us to move beyond Black’s
                                        (2017: 6) view that “there is only a 50% chance that that
                                        scribe was provided by Argyll rather than O’Donnell”.</p>
