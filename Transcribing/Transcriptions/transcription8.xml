								<p comment="Content">This single quatrain in <hi rend="italics"
										>rannaigecht beag</hi> is not only lacking in context but is
									also missing two syllables each from lines a and c. As a result,
									its interpretation is difficult. The best attempt is a text and
									translation by William MacKenzie, with the assistance of William
									Watson (MacKenzie <ref type="bib" target="MacKenzie1939"
										>1939</ref>: 137), who acknowledges that their reading is
									uncertain. Their translation is as follows: <quote>
										<l>… (from the tears) of the meeting,</l>
										<l>now that the world has sped its leafage</l>
										<l>… (bank) close to a pool,</l>
										<l>(that?) we have found on the surface of the round
											world.</l>
										<l>I (am) Donald Gorm</l>
									</quote>
								</p>
								<p>In this reading the quatrain is celebrating some sort of
									fellowship or friendship, now gone. Its passing is compared to
									the fall of leaves in autumn. The friendship is compared to, or
									exemplified by, a scene on the banks of a pool. This intimate
									image is contrasted with its context in the vastness of the
									world, which presumably now separates the friends. The quatrain
									is followed by the signature, "misi dom<hi rend="italics"
									>h</hi>nall gorm", Domhnall Gorm being a popular name among the
									chiefs of the MacDonalds of Sleat. If the inscription was made
									to celebrate the friendship of a Domhnall Gorm of Sleat and Lord
									Sinclair, or a relative, then this is most apposite.</p>
								<p>There are, however, two major problems with this translation.
									First, <hi rend="italics">cioth</hi> can mean "shower",
									"abundance", or "struggle" but "tears" is an apparently
									otherwise unattested poetic extension. Secondly, "<hi
										rend="italics">air</hi> buain" as the perfect form of <hi
										rend="italics">búainid</hi> would be a striking
									vernacularism in a formal and still early poem; it should surely
									be taken as a preposition (either <hi rend="italics">íar</hi> or
										<hi rend="italics">ar</hi>) and a verbal noun. and the
									subject need not be "biot<hi rend="italics">h</hi>".
									Furthermore, "na coin<hi rend="italics">n</hi>e" need not be
									analysed as art. + noun; "na" could also be <hi rend="italics">i
											<hi rend="sup">n-</hi>
									</hi> + poss. 3rd sing. fem., forming the phrase "against
									her/it", possibly referring to <hi rend="italics">bith</hi> on
									the next line.</p>
								<p>A resulting alternative translation, with most of the changes in
									the first couplet, would be:<quote>
										<l>...to struggle against it,</l>
										<l>against the world, to reap its foliage;</l>
										<l>...{on the} bank, close to a pool</l>
										<l>that we found on the surface of the round world.</l>
										<l>I am Domhnall Gorm.</l>
									</quote>
								</p>
								<p>Other intepretations are surely possible. For the purposes of the
									present text and discussion, Mackenzie/Watson's reading will be
									followed, except for the substitution in of a more context
									sensitive interpretation of "<hi rend="italics">air</hi>
									buain".</p>
								<p>A text was also attempted by J. T. T. Brown, with a translation
									from Rev. Robert Blair (Brown <ref target="Brown1899" type="bib"
										>1899</ref>: 151). However, Brown's transcription is so
									inaccurate that this is best left unconsidered.</p>
								<p comment="Style">The metre is <hi rend="italics">rannaigecht
										beag</hi> (7<hi rend="sup">2</hi>7<hi rend="sup">2</hi>7<hi
										rend="sup">2</hi>7<hi rend="sup">2</hi>). All metrical rules
									are observed, as far as is visible. The tone is elegaic and
									lyrical, although, as noted above, its stance is still open to
									interpretation.</p>
								<p comment="Social Context and Intended Readers">The quatrain is
									thought to have been inscribed during the 16<hi rend="sup"
										>th</hi> century. The manuscript was produced sometime after
									1489 and a note mentioning the date 1592 appears below the
									quatrain on fol. 231<hi rend="sup">v</hi>. While the quatrain
									could be later than this note, it is more likely to be
									contemporary or earlier (Black, <ref type="bib"
										target="Black2017">2017</ref>: §127). This is also the
									period when multiple individuals named Domhnall Gorm, or
									thereabouts, were chiefs of the MacDonalds of Sleat and when the
									manuscript was still owned by the Sinclair family. Domhnall Gorm
									Mór (d. 1616) was in Edinburgh, as a prisoner, in 1589
									(MacDonald &amp; MacDonald <ref target="MacDonald1904"
										type="bib">1904</ref>: 34–35). Brown also identifies him as
									the Domhnall Gorm in question (Brown <ref target="Brown1899"
										type="bib">1899</ref>: 146). It is perhaps too fanciful to
									imagine him borrowing the Sinclair's copy of <hi rend="italics"
										>The Kingis Quair</hi>, itself written in the persona of a
									high-status prisoner, and inscribing the present text in
									gratitude and as his own reflection. Suffice to say, given the
									provenance and ownership of the manuscript and the likely status
									of Domhnall Gorm, this poem should be understood as courtly
									communication between aristocrats. Thus it joins other pieces of
									evidence for Classical Gaelic literacy among the late medieval
									Scottish Gaelic nobility (see also Black <ref type="bib"
										>1978</ref>; Gillies <ref type="bib">Autumn 1978</ref>;
									Gillies <ref type="bib">Summer 1982</ref>). Indeed, it even
									implies an interest in Gaelic literature among the nobility far
									outside the core Gaelic world of the time.</p>
								<p comment="Studies and Editions">The only useable text and
									translation of the quatrain is that by MacKenzie (<ref
										type="bib" target="MacKenzie1939">1939</ref>: 137). There is
									also the superseded attempt by Brown (Brown <ref
										target="Brown1899" type="bib">1899</ref>: 151). The
									manuscript is available in facsimile (Boffey &amp; Edwards:
									1997).</p>

												si<hi rend="italics">n</hi>e" (<ref
												type="ed_text_line" target="MS8.1.1d">q1d</ref>),
												if it is to be taken as a relative, may also show

								</note>
								<note comment="Style">
									<p>As noted, the context of the fragment, both in terms of the
										rest of the quatrain and more widely, is lacking, meaning
										its use of language is difficult to interpret. It appears to
										be lyrical and elegaic, employing several images of nature
										or of pastoral scenes, possibly to describe the transience
										of things. This is all presented in a formal bardic metre
										and Classical language. It appears to be in the 1st person
										plural ("si<hi rend="italics">n</hi>e" (<ref
											type="ed_text_line" target="MS8.1.1d">q1d</ref>)),
										suggesting some sort of authorial presence, reinforced by
										the following signature. This implies that it is meant to be
										some sort of direct communication, although, from what
										survives, it appears to communicate largely by synechdochic
										allusion. The vocabulary is relatively mainstream, however,
										and there are no overt literary references to legendary
										people or places — although something may have been crammed
										into the lost four syllables — making the quatrain
										relatively approachable to anyone aware of the context but
										not necessarily highly learned in Gaelic tradition. All this
										reinforces the theory that this is a courtly communication
										between aristocrats, most likely a Domhnall Gorm of Sleat
										and a member of the Sinclair family.</p>
